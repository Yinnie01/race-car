# Race Car Competition Using C language

## This is my first project working with C language.

I employed the following principles and concepts:
  1. Basics - varian=bles and operators
  2. Control Flow - conditionals, loops and errors
  3. Data Structures in C
  4. Functionss
  5. Arrays
  6. Memory manipulation

I solidified my understanding of these principles, that I had come across while learning Python and JavaScript languages.
